# trump_clinton_text_analysis

This repository contains replication data and R and Python scripts for my blog post on Clinton and Trump speeches in the US presidential election cycle of 2016. 

For copyright reasons, the original speech data is not provided. Instead, a "speeches_urls.csv" contains the links to the speech transcripts.
